# Desktop app-like launch

If you want it to behave like a desktop app without extra wrappers:

## Edge

```powershell
msedge.exe --app=https://YOUR-PAGES-URL
```

## Chrome

```powershell
chrome.exe --app=https://YOUR-PAGES-URL
```

This opens a frameless app window and works well with installed PWA mode.
